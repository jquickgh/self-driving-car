Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.

The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
